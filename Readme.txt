I have completed the 8 tutorials done by this youtuber, so the link is the library of videos.


There was additional tutorials on how to fully implement the game but I wanted to have fun and add basic shooting etc.


I have changed the shooting mechanic script completely from the tutorial. I shoot blue circles now and depending on the flip of the user, the direction of the circles change aswell
